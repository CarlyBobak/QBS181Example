This is an example repository for students to interact with as part of QBS181 at Dartmouth College.

Each folder contains a project, representing different groups of datasets we've wrangled so far. Within project folders we have separate folders for data, for programs, and for results.

Students who add programs to the repository should be sure to include their student ID in the name of the program file.
